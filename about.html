				<p class="lead">BeeQTLdb is an integrated resource of genotype-phenotype associations in honey bee.</p>
				<p>Honey bee genomics is an expanding field of research with a large number of publications on honey bee biology, health, and diseases. Linkage and association mapping have been used to link genetic polymorphisms to phenotypic variation observed in individuals, colonies, and populations of honey bees. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping has proven valuable for studying the genetic architecture of various traits in honey bees and determining genomic positions associated with causal polymorphisms and their relative effect sizes. However, given the decreasing cost of genome sequencing, genome-wide studies (GWAS) are expected to improve the resolution of genotype-phenotype mapping. Information on identified genomic regions associated with various phenotypic traits is scattered in the scientific literature. The results come from studies exploiting different methodological approaches and experimental populations, and the traits studied have also been defined in different ways.</p>
				<p>H. Here, we collected QTL in honey bees associated with a variety of traits (e.g., fertility, pathogen resistance, behavioural traits) from the literature. Data were manually curated and mapped to the current honey bee genome assembly (Amel_HAv3.1).</p>
				<p>The database provides comprehensive information on QTL (e.g., marker system used, experimental population, reference) and allows combining results from multiple studies. Users can confirm or narrow down the candidate genomic regions from overlapping QTL results. BeeQTLdb was developed to facilitate interpretation of genotype-phenotype correlations and prioritisation of candidate genes in the honey bee genome.</p>
